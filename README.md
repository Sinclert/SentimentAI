# Sentiment AI üìä

This project is based on the code used in my CS Bachelor's thesis research. Its main goal is to provide a simple way of training ML models to perform classification over tweets (using Twitter APIs). The models can be combined, using a JSON configuration file, in order to build a hierarchical classifier in the shape of a tree, where nodes are trained models and leaves are the different categories.<br>

<br>

Althought the models could be trained using datasets of very different nature, one of the most straightforward applications is to build a sentiment analysis hierarchical classifier. This particular classification example is hosted online using packages such as Flask and Gunicorn, to show the project potential capabilities.<br>

## How does it work?

### General scheme:
<img src="resources/images/project_steps.png"/>

First of all,  the ML models are trained:<br>
<b>1. Datasets:</b> they are text files containing one sentence per row.<br>
<b>2. Sentences cleaning:</b> tokenize, remove stopwords and extract the lemma of each word.<br>
<b>3. Features vectors:</b> build feature vectors using unigrams (words) and bigrams (pairs of words).<br>
<b>4. Features selection:</b> get the most informative features (input percentage) using chi-square test.<br>
<b>5. Filter features:</b> filter the current features leaving only the most informative ones.<br>
<b>6. Train classifier:</b> use Scikit-learn algorithms:<br>
- <i>Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes.</i><br>
- <i>Logistic Regression.</i><br>
- <i>Linear Support Vector Machine.</i><br>
- <i>Random Forest (100 trees).</i><br>

<br>

Secondly, the tweets are extracted and processed:<br>
<b>7. Tweets extraction:</b> obtain tweets from Twitter APIs using Tweepy.<br>
<b>8. Tweets preprocessing:</b> tokenize, remove stopwords and extract the lemma of each word.<br>
<b>9. Features vectors:</b> build feature vectors using unigrams (words) and bigrams (pairs of words).<br>
<b>10. Filter features:</b> filter the current features leaving only the most informative ones.<br>

<br>

Finally, the classification is performed:<br>
<b>11. Classification:</b> the trained models classify the vector of features into one of the final categories.<br>

<br>

### Classification process:
The classification is performed in a hierarchical way. This means that the trained models are placed in the nodes of a tree, and depending on how the upper models classify a given piece of information, it will follow one branch or another.<br>

<br>

The advantages os this approach over a classic multi-label category are:<br>
- There could be different classifier algorithms as nodes, depending on which one perform best.<br>
- The set of most informative features is specific for each label-to-label differentiation.<br>

<br>

Following with the sentiment analysis case, there are 3 possible categories: neutral, positive and negative. They are represented as leaves in the classification tree, so once the assigned category to the text is one of those, the process is over. The classification tree would have this shape:<br>

<img src="resources/images/hierarchical_clf.png" width="500" height="400"/>

In order to build a this custom classification tree, a JSON file with the following structure is required:

```json
    {
        "tree": {
            "clf_file": "subjetivity.pickle",
            "clf_object": null,
            "clf_children": {
                "polarized": {
                    "clf_file": "sentiment.pickle",
                    "clf_object": null,
                    "clf_children": {}
                }
            }
        },
        "colors": {
            "neutral": [0.6, 0.6, 0.6],
            "negative": [0.8, 0.0, 0.0],
            "positive": [0.0, 0.8, 0.0]
        }
    }
```

<br>


### Models evaluation:
The evaluation of the different models (defined by algorithm and percentage of informative features) is done using <b>10 Folds Cross Validation</b>. This method divides the datasets in 10 folds, performing 10 iterations where 9 are used for training and 1 for testing. Finally, the mean of the results is calculated.<br>

<br>

However, the evaluation procedure is not the only relevant factor to decide, choosing a good fitness metric is crucial to perform a good comparison. In this project, the evaluation metric is the <b>F-score</b>, which is better than common accuracy because it considers unbalance classification between categories (Explanation here).<br>
